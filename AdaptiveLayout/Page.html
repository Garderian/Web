        <div id ="article"><p>Amber, rapture of wilderness, chaos of maelstroms, bone-breaking laughter,
rider of the Vortex's edge, open to the heart of thy lowly servant.
To the righteous will of the seeker of thine guidance, heed.
Meet blood with blood, taboo breaker. Bind! Crushing flesh, twisting mind, constrict!
Feed your thirst, bury him underhill, kill!
Formidable Azure, approaching storm, bringer of Death, searing whip,
executioner's blade, open to the heart of thy lowly servant.
To the one approaching as storm, cutting as axe, rising as Death, to me praying to thee, answer.
My fow to the depths of pain, into the Vortex of suffering, throw.
While you Torcher tear him from within, be slow.
When he cries out to thee, his voice begging mercy, be silent.
Violet, vibrant chameleon of colors, mysterious tale,
lair of the Archane, come to my core, aid in my vengeance,
battling a hideous, wicked, unfamiliar foe, help me.
By lies and deceit, the one who challenges my righteousness, shall die.
The one who watched me, in hope of exposing my weakness, be blind.
His color shall fail, his hammer shall fall, his voice—shall quiver.
Emerald, heavy and viscous as tar, enveloping canopy, invulnerable shield,
arbiter of scales, bestow thy power to this venerable warrior.
To me, who raised the vengeful hammer, listen.
Fiendish plot of the heretic, who dares resist, twist.
His treacherous soul, chaotic and insane, banish.
Cold-blooded Argent, unbendable backbone, treasury of the forsaken kingdom,
patron of the takers, strengthen thy servant.
The one who listens to thee, searches for thee, and is blindly obedient, shall be answered.
The skin of the Keeper, his tendons, ligaments, and muscles, shall be hardened.
His heart, open to Lympha of all colors, shall be warmed.
Wasters of all colors who dare to give, shall be tortured.
Crimson, furious, color of avengers and prophets, banner of the righteous,
essence of blood, grant power to thy warrior messenger.
Me, thy faithful warrior messenger, recall.
Sharpen my blade, my strike with thy destructive might, provide.
Blood and nerve from my foes' sinews, yield.
Guide the edge of my sword, my target—slay.</p>
